title: L3 v L2 MTU

During my review for the CCNA, the topic of MTU differing between L3 and L2 was rather confusing - probably because I kept reviewing them separately and not in context.

I can now report understanding why it is thus, being akin to a series of boxes that must not be larger than the box they lie within.

To insert more detail: L1 streams the entirety of the frame/data up to the maximum transmission unit, and thus sets the true maximum ceiling.

All layers higher up the chain -must- necessarily strip away a shell (header/footer) to gain access to their desired information, necessarily reducing the total size of the message.

L3, by default, will not route packets larger than 1500 bytes.
L2, by default, will forward packets up to 1514 bytes (53 bytes if using Asynchronous Transfer Mode)

Both layers are happy to break up data batches into smaller individual parts with singular sizes below the MTU - to be reassembled at the destination.

The packet/frame can refuse fragmentation if the DF bit is flipped to 1, which will cause the routing/switching device to drop the frame/packet and report an icmp Type 3 (Dest unreachable) Code 4 (needed frag, but DF=1) error to sender.

If we just allow larger packet and frame sizes from the get-go, we can run into issues with lengthy processing times in our routing devices, since they're generally optimized around the industry standard 1500.
