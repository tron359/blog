Heavy (and lengthy) set of labs explicitly focused on evaluating, understanding, breaking, and investigating methods of attack.

A lovely series of linux-focused security concepts, played through the browser, utilizing a capture the flag style. Does not hold the user's hand, but provides clear instructions. Expect to perform a lot of command searching
