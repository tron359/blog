Spent a couple hours learning how github pages work, scrapped my first abomination, then reverted over to the guided creation tool.

Need to transfer the posts from the external blog into here next.

On the side, spending a significant amount of time yesterday and today reviewing MITRE, PICER, and a few other critical components of SOC.
