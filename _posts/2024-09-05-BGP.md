Title: BGP and ROA
---
The USA is remarkably behind the globe when it comes to BGP security and validation, with only 39% using Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) according to a recent June filing by the FCC, compared to the 70% global adoption rate.

Hostile takeovers are not strictly trivial, since it seems an agent still needs their existing address space to first be registered with ARIN/RADB, and load balancing tryies to prevent the majority of traffic from overloading any one route that claims to have the most efficient pathway.

Buuuut, updates to BGP routing are not independently verified by the table, leaving the potential for an actor to accidentally (or not) advertise a BGP route that either deadends, routes through a hostile system, or pulls significantly more traffic than desirable.

The use of RPKI's two components, Route Origin Authorizations and Route Origin Validation, allow vendors to check sender and recipient address blocks to verify the advertised routes are indeed available, legal, and real. This system does not work without widespread use of ROV, though, since one cannot verify a signal that is never sent.
