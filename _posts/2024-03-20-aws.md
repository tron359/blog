title: Terraform and AWS

Today is progressing in an interesting direction, but starting with some Terraform debugging, running into issues with the image id claiming to not exist, despite directly copying the id over.

This puzzled me at first, as I had JUST gone through selecting the region - following the documentation, and successfully created a server through the web console.

Turns out my browser switched the region over to east-1 at some point, with an entirely different set of image IDs for the same server images

After a quick rotation of region, and a copy of the new and proper id, the server instance has now successfully launched with Terraform, with functional connectivity and security filters in place.

A couple hours later, and we've expanded into an apache2 server with a functional interface.

After this, we destroy the instance, and set the tools aside for tomorrow.
