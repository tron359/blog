title: Terraform and AWS
---

Today is progressing in an interesting direction, but first we start with some debugging:

This puzzled me at first, as I had JUST gone through selecting the region - following the documentation, and successfully created a server through the web console.

Turns out my browser switched the region over to east-1 at some point, with an entirely different set of image IDs for the same server images.

After a quick rotation of region, and a copy of the new and proper id, the server instance has now successfully launched with Terraform:

A couple hours later, and we've expanded into an apache2 server with a functional interface.

After this, we destroy the instance, and set the tools aside for tomorrow.
