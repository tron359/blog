For HackTheBox, after opting to use OpenVPN, the website provides a pre-configured connection with what looks to be a global unique address.

The use of a Global Unique initially surprised me; I was expecting a unique local within the tunnel, especially as the website indicated the connection would be on the same local subnet as the target device. Nothing stops the global address from being in the same subnet, I just wasn't expecting it in a vpn context.

A global address is still a reasonable option as far as I know, being as this is a public environment, and I'd expect a GUA would be more easily troubleshooted (ping etc) compared to a ULA.

While it's not shown, I'm wondering if a packet sniffer would show the connection does indeed have a hidden destination/source ULA that just isn't displayed in the default view.

Side note, the network block portion had an amusing name, dead:beef::
