title: SIEM, Sentinel, Azure
---
Spun up an Azure VM to use as a honeypot for some SIEM practice. 

Hooked up a data connector to pulls all VM logs into Sentinel for ingestion, then set up a filter for login events.

Will leave up overnight, take a look through what got pulled in, then take the system offline.
