First, we wrote more scripts, then we deployed several containers, and figured out how to create local and remote repositories.

Personally, some work went into making pasta and sauce by hand, and this week included a delicious chili.

Backend work has been spent on delving into network fundamentals, BASH and SQL scripting, researching certs (probably getting the CCNA, whole-hog).

Incoming work to be spent on integrating Terraform into the workflow, and deploying scripts to AWS.
