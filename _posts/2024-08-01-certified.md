The last few months have been spent on:

1. Planning a move down to Atlanta, including the sale of almost all my possessions

2. Studying for the CCNA using Jeremy's IT Lab youtube series, thousands of flash cards, and Boson

3. Quitting my nursing job to recover from burnout, and to properly focus on passing my certification exam

4. Finally, as of 2 days ago, successfully passing on my first try.

Here's how the score breakdown came about:

..with much of the drop in the middle likely coming from the entire lab question I had to skip near the end due to time constraints. I've never been a particularly fast exam taker, but I've definitely learned that some problems are best left to the side, revisited on a fresh day.

It's been a good year, and I'm finding enjoyment in solving the small and big problems that come with planning and actually executing changes in my life.
