title: Background Check Scams
---
Interesting evening today, been looking at housing options in the new city I'm moving to, came across a unit that seemed just a bit too good to be true. 
After contacting, swiftly recieved a text asking some general screening question, ultimately leading to a request for details via a suspiciously nebulous website link.
After some quick WHOIS searching, determined the domain was purchased a mere 27 days ago from namecheap, with additional searching coming up with the plaintext name, email, phone number, and city of the owner.
While I couldn't confirm that these details matched the presumed scammer, I sent an abuse report to Namecheap to try and stop the domain from continuing to harm more consumers.
