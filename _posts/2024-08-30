title: Jekyll Troubles
---
Actually getting a desirable format, WITHOUT prior web dev experience, has been a bothersome time. 

Issue 1: The title kept duplicating in the Header, over the Posts, and at the bottom of the page.
Issue 2: Scattered documentation - with exact questions difficult to pin down beyond basic descriptions and formatting rules.

This is largely my fault for trying to do all of this on my own, and in one day, and using an automated tool that wants to do a good job but doesn't know how wihtout instructions, but STILL.

I ended up just removing the offending title entry.
